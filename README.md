### About the project
---

We are going to build a `Employee Directory Application` by creating a multi subnet VPC for hosting a App-data base (Dynamo Db), S3 bucket to store media files  and creating a auto scaling group using Cloud monitoring.

We are going to use  EC2 as compute engine to load up the Flask application code in the user data channel before lanching the instances.

In order to connect this serves to the compute instances we are going to setup a `IAM role` from the aws policies.

### Stage-1 Creating an IAM role

*creating a IAM role

1.Make sure that you are  logined as `IAM user` rather than root user.
1.Search for `IAM` in the search bar.
